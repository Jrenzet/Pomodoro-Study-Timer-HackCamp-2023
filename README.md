Extension:
    make a joson file that runs in chrom (empty)

Blocker:
    URL Blocker that blocks one url

Timer:
    Prodomo that runs 15s and breaks 10s
        Logic part: clock.js monitors the time, and return a string of time "HH:MM:SS" (for the UI rendering)  and a state "0", "1"


Timer will pass a variable to the blocker, letting it stop/start the block
